# NCU-Babies-Hacker
A small group for NCU students who want to learn Hacking.

## About our schedule
We will have a share of write-ups of CTF for 2 times a week, and talking about the lastest topic each 2 weeks.
Furthermore, in the sharing, we will have to take a deep look into details of how it works and the demo.
